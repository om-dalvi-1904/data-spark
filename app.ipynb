       "AIMessage(content='**Generative AI** refers to a category of artificial intelligence models that are designed to **create new, original content** rather than simply analyze or classify existing data. Unlike traditional AI that might identify a cat in an image, generative AI can *create* an image of a cat that has never existed before.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of what that means:\\n\\n1.  **\"Generative\" Aspect:**\\n    *   It\\'s not just retrieving information or performing a fixed task.\\n    *   It\\'s about producing something novel, whether it\\'s text, images, audio, video, code, or other data types.\\n    *   The output often mimics the style, characteristics, and patterns of the data it was trained on, but it\\'s not a direct copy.\\n\\n2.  **How it Works (Simplified):**\\n    *   **Training:** Generative AI models are trained on vast datasets (e.g., millions of images, billions of text documents). During this training, they learn the underlying patterns, structures, and relationships within the data. For instance, a text model learns grammar, syntax, semantics, and common discourse patterns. An image model learns about shapes, colors, textures, and how objects relate in a scene.\\n    *   **Learning Distributions:** Essentially, the model learns the \"distribution\" of the training data – what combinations of features are common, rare, or impossible.\\n    *   **Generation (Inference):** When given a **prompt** (an input, like a text description for an image, or a question for a chatbot), the model uses its learned understanding to predict and construct new data that fits the prompt and is consistent with the patterns it learned. It essentially tries to generate the \"most probable\" next piece of information (a word, a pixel, a sound wave) until a complete output is formed.\\n\\n3.  **Key Characteristics:**\\n    *   **Creativity (Pseudo-Creativity):** It can produce unique and diverse outputs, sometimes leading to surprising and innovative results.\\n    *   **Adaptability:** Many models can be fine-tuned or instructed to generate content in specific styles or formats.\\n    *   **Multimodality:** Some advanced generative AI can work across different types of data, such as generating images from text descriptions (text-to-image) or generating speech from text (text-to-speech).\\n\\n4.  **Common Types and Examples:**\\n    *   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** These generate human-like text. Examples include OpenAI\\'s GPT series (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4), Google\\'s Gemini, Anthropic\\'s Claude. They can write articles, summarize texts, answer questions, translate languages, and generate code.\\n    *   **Image Generators:** These create images from text prompts or modify existing images. Examples include DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion.\\n    *   **Audio Generators:** These can create music, sound effects, or synthetic speech (e.g., text-to-speech).\\n    *   **Video Generators:** Emerging models that can create short video clips from text or images.\\n    *   **Code Generators:** Tools like GitHub Copilot can suggest and write code based on natural language descriptions or existing code.\\n\\n5.  **Use Cases:**\\n    *   Content creation (writing articles, marketing copy, poetry)\\n    *   Art and design (generating concept art, logos, UI elements)\\n    *   Software development (generating code, debugging assistance)\\n    *   Personalization (tailoring content, recommendations)\\n    *   Data augmentation (creating synthetic data for training other AI models)\\n    *   Drug discovery and materials science (generating novel molecular structures)\\n    *   Education (creating learning materials, interactive tutors)\\n\\n**In essence, Generative AI empowers machines to be creators, moving beyond analytical tasks to produce entirely new digital artifacts, transforming how we interact with technology and sparking innovation across countless industries.**\\n\\nHowever, it also comes with challenges like potential for \"hallucinations\" (generating plausible but false information), bias from training data, ethical concerns around deepfakes, and intellectual property issues.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b4940-e59d-79d0-9ed2-c783a1aaf0b6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 7, 'output_tokens': 2068, 'total_tokens': 2075, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 1192}})"

In our day to day life, we \\nneed to measure a number of quantities, e.g., \\nsize of objects, volume of liquids, amount of \\nmatter, weight of vegetables or fruits, body \\ntemperature, length of cloth, etc. A measurement \\nalways involves a comparison with a standard \\nmeasuring unit which is internationally \\naccepted. For example, for measuring the mass \\nof a given fruit we need standard mass units \\nof 1 kg, 500 g, etc. These standards are called \\nunits. The measured quantity is expressed in \\nterms of a number followed by a corresponding \\nunit, e.g., the length of a wire is written as 5 m \\nwhere m (metre) is the unit and 5 is the value of \\nthe length in that unit. Different quantities are \\nmeasured in different units, e.g. length in metre \\n(m), time in seconds (s), mass in kilogram (kg), \\netc. The standard measure of any quantity is \\ncalled the unit of that quantity. \\n1.2 System of Units:\\nIn our earlier standards we have come \\nacross various systems of units namely\\n (i)  CGS: Centimetre  Gram Second system\\n (ii)  MKS: Metre Kilogram Second system\\n (iii) FPS: Foot Pound Second system.\\n (iv) SI: System International\\nThe first three systems namely CGS, MKS \\nand FPS were used extensively till recently.  In \\n1971, the 14\\nth International general conference \\non weights and measures recommended the \\nuse of ‘International system' of units. This \\ninternational system of units is called the \\nSI units. As the SI units use decimal system, \\nconversion within the system is very simple and \\nconvenient.\\n1. What is a unit?\\n2. Which units have you used in the laboratory for measuring \\n  (i) length (ii) mass (iii) time (iv) temperature?\\n3. Which system of units have you used?  \\nUnits and Measurements\\nCan you recall?\\n1.2.1 Fundamental Quantities and Units:  \\nThe physical quantities which do not \\ndepend on any other physical quantities for \\ntheir measurements are known as fundamental \\nquantities. There are seven fundamental \\nquantities: length, mass, time, temperature, \\nelectric current, luminous intensity and amount \\nof substance. \\nFundamental units: The units used to measure \\nfundamental quantities are called fundamental \\nunits.

We know that electric \\ncurrent can be used to make an electromagnet. \\nAn electromagnet attracts magnetic materials \\nand is thus used in research and in industrial \\napplications such as cranes to lift heavy \\npieces of iron/steel. Thus the kilogram mass \\ncan be described in terms of the amount of \\ncurrent which has to be passed through an \\nelectromagnet so that it can pull down one side \\nof an extremely sensitive balance to balance the \\nother side which holds one standard kg mass.\\nWhile dealing with mass of atoms \\nand molecules, kg is an inconvenient unit. \\nTherefore, their mass is measured in atomic \\nmass unit. It will be easy to compare mass of \\nany atom in terms of mass of some standard \\natom which has been decided internationally to \\nbe C\\n12 atom. The (1/12)th mass of an unexcited \\natom of C12 is called atomic mass unit (amu). \\n1 amu = 1.6605402\\uf0cd10 -27 kg with an \\nuncertainty of 10 in the last two decimal places. \\n1.5 Measurement of Time:\\nThe SI unit of time is the second (s).

Observations of various \\nphysical quantities are made during an \\nexperiment. For example, during the \\natmospheric study we measure atmospheric \\npressure, wind velocity, humidity, etc. All the \\nmeasurements may be accurate, meaning that \\nthe measured values are the same as the true \\nvalues. Accuracy is how close a measurement \\nis to the actual value of that quantity. These \\nmeasurements may be precise, meaning that \\nmultiple measurements give nearly identical \\nvalues (i.e., reproducible results). In actual \\nmeasurements, an observation may be both \\naccurate and precise or neither accurate nor \\nprecise. The goal of the observer should be to \\nget accurate as well as precise measurements.\\nPossible uncertainties in an observation \\nmay arise due to following reasons:\\n1) Quality of instrument used.\\n2) Skill of the person doing the experiment.\\n3) The method used for measurement.\\n4) External or internal factors affecting the \\nresult of the experiment.\\nIf ten students are asked to measure the \\nlength of a piece of cloth up to a mm, using a \\nmetre scale, do you think their answers will \\nbe identical? Give reasons.  \\nCan you tell?\\n1.8 Errors in Measurements:\\nFaulty measurements of physical quantity \\ncan lead to errors.

Sources of systematic \\nerror may be due to imperfect calibration of the \\ninstrument, and sometimes imperfect method of \\nobservation.\\nEach of these errors tends to be in one \\ndirection, either positive or negative. The \\nsources of systematic errors are as follows:\\n (i)  Instrumental error: This type of error \\narises due to defective calibration of an \\ninstrument, for example an incorrect \\nzeroing of an instrument will lead to such \\nkind of error ('zero' of a thermometer not \\ngraduated at proper place, the pointer \\nof weighting balance in the laboratory \\nalready indicating some value instead of \\nshowing zero when no load is kept on it, \\nan ammeter showing a current of 0.5 amp \\neven when not connected in circuit, etc).\\n (ii) Error due to imperfection in \\nexperimental technique: This is an error \\ndue to defective setting of an instrument. \\nFor example the measured volume of a \\nliquid in a graduated tube will be inaccurate \\nif the tube is not held vertical. \\n (iii) Personal error: Such errors are \\nintroduced due to fault of the observer. \\nBias of the observer, carelessness in \\ntaking observations etc. could result in \\nsuch errors. For example, while measuring \\nthe length of an object with a ruler, it is \\nnecessary to look at the ruler directly from \\nabove. If the observer looks at it from an \\nangle, the measured length will be wrong \\ndue to parallax.\\n  Systematic errors can be minimized by \\nusing correct instrument, following proper \\nexperimental procedure and removing \\npersonal error.\\nb) Random errors: These are the errors which \\nare introduced even after following all the \\nprocedures to minimize systematic errors. These \\ntype of errors may be positive or negative. These \\nerrors can not be eliminated completely but we \\ncan minimize them by repeated observations \\nand then taking their mean (average). Random \\nerrors occur due to variation in conditions in \\nwhich experiment is performed. For example, \\nthe temperature may change during the course \\nof an experiment, pressure of any gas used in \\nthe experiment may change, or the voltage of \\nthe power supply may change randomly, etc.\\n1.8.1 Estimation of error: \\nSuppose the readings recorded repeatedly \\nfor a physical quantity during a measurement \\nare \\na\\n1, a2, a3, ................an .\\nArithmetic mean amean  is given by\\na= a+ a+ a+ ................+a\\nn\\na= n a\\nmean\\n12 3n\\nmean i\\ni=1\\nn1\\n--- (1.3)\\nThis is the most probable value of the \\nquantity.

Thus, metre is defined \\nas the distance traveled by light in \\nvacuum in exactly 1/299792458 second.\\n (iv) The figures show the dependency of \\nvarious units upon their respective \\nconstants and other units (wherever \\nused). The arrows arriving at that unit \\nrefer to the constant and the fundamental \\nunit (or units, wherever used) for defining \\nthat unit. The arrows going away from a \\nunit indicate other units which use this \\nunit for their definition. \\nFor example, as described above, in Fig (a),  \\ni) the arrows directed to metre are from second \\nand c. The arrows going away from the metre \\nindicate that the metre is used in defining \\nthe kilogram the candela and the kelvin,  \\n(ii) the newly defined unit kilogram uses \\nPlanck constant, the metre and the second, \\nwhile the kilogram itself is used in defining \\nthe kelvin and the candela. This definition \\nrelates the kilogram to the equivalent mass of \\nthe energy of a photon given its frequency, \\nvia the Planck constant.\\nFig (a) refers to new definitions while the \\nFig (b) refers to the corresponding definitions \\nbefore 20 May 2019.

You will learn calculus in \\ndetails, in mathematics, in the XII\\nth standard. \\nIn this Chapter, you are going to learn about \\nvector analysis and will have a preliminary \\nintroduction to calculus which should be \\nsufficient for you to understand the physics that \\nyou will learn in this book.\\n2.2 Vector Analysis:\\n In the previous Chapter, you have studied \\ndifferent aspects of physical quantities like \\ntheir division into fundamental and derived \\nquantities and their units and dimensions. \\nYou also need to understand that all physical \\nquantities may not be fully described by their \\nmagnitudes and units alone. For example if you \\nare given the time for which a man has walked \\nwith a certain speed, you can find the distance \\ntravelled by the man, but you cannot find out \\nwhere exactly the man has reached unless \\nyou know the direction in which the man has \\nwalked.\\nTherefore, you can say that some physical \\nquantities, which are called scalars, can be \\ndescribed with magnitude alone, whereas some \\nother physical quantities, which are called \\nvectors, need to be described with magnitude \\nas well as direction. In the above example the \\ndistance travelled by the man is a scalar quantity \\nwhile the final position of the man relative to \\nhis initial position, i.e., his displacement can be \\ndescribed by magnitude and direction and is a \\nvector quantity.  In this  Chapter  you will study \\ndifferent aspects of scalar and vector quantities. \\n2.2.1 Scalars: \\n Physical quantities which can be completely \\nMathematical Methods\\n1. What is the difference between a scalar and a vector?\\n2. Which of the following are scalars or vectors? \\n  (i) displacement (ii) distance travelled (iii) velocity \\n  (iv) speed (v) force (vi) work done (vii) energy\\nCan you recall?\\n2.\\ndescribed by their magnitude are called scalars, \\ni.e. they are specified by a number and a unit. \\nFor example when we say that a given metal \\nrod has a length 2 m, it indicates that the rod \\nis two times longer than a certain standard unit \\nmetre. Thus the number 2 is the magnitude \\nand metre is the unit; together they give us a \\ncomplete idea about the length of the rod. Thus \\nlength is a scalar quantity. Similarly mass, time, \\ntemperature, density, etc., are examples of \\nscalars. Scalars can be added or subtracted by \\nrules of simple algebra.\\n2.2.2 Vectors:\\nPhysical quantities which need magnitude \\nas well as direction for their complete \\ndescription are called vectors. Examples of \\nvectors are displacement, velocity, force etc.\\nA vector can be represented by a directed \\nline segment or by an arrow. The length of the \\nline segment drawn to scale gives the magnitude \\nof the vector, e.g., displacement of a body from \\nP to Q can be represented as P \\n Q, \\nwhere the starting point P is called the tail \\nand the end point Q (arrow head) is called the \\nhead of the vector. Symbolically we write it as  \\nPQ\\nuru\\n. Symbolically vectors are also represented \\nby a single capital letter with an arrow above \\nit, e.g., XA\\nuruu r\\n ,  , etc. Magnitude of a vector X\\nuru\\n is \\nwritten as | X\\nuru\\n|.\\nLet us see a few examples of different \\ntypes of vectors.\\n (a)  Zero vector (Null vector):  A vector \\nhaving zero magnitude with a particular \\ndirection (arbitrary) is called zero vector. \\nSymbolically it is represented as 0\\n\\uf072\\n. \\n  (1) Velocity vector of a stationary particle \\nis a zero vector.\\n  (2) The acceleration vector of an object'),\n",

For example x could be the \\nposition of a particle moving along x-axis and  \\ny = f(x) could be its velocity at that position \\nx. We can thus draw a graph of y against x as \\nshown in Fig. 2.12 (a). Let A and B be two points \\non the curve giving values of y at x = x\\n0 and  \\nx = x0 + ∆x, where ∆x is a small increment in x. \\nThe slope of the straight line joining A and B is \\ngiven by tan /g84/g32/g39\\n/g39\\ny\\nx\\n. \\nIf we make ∆x smaller, the point B will \\ncome closer to A and  if we keep making ∆x \\nsmaller and smaller, we will ultimately  reach a \\nstage when B will coincide with A.

What is meant by motion?   2. What is rectilinear motion? \\n3. What is the difference between displacement and distance travelled?\\n4. What is the difference between uniform and nonuniform motion?\\nCan you recall?\\n3.1 Introduction:\\nWe see objects moving all around us. Motion \\nis a change in the position of an object with time. \\nWe have come across the motion of a toy car \\nwhen pushed along some particular direction, \\nthe motion of a cricket ball hit by a batsman for \\na sixer and the motion of an aeroplane from one \\nplace to another. The motion of objects can be \\ndivided in three categories: (1) motion along a \\nstraight line, i.e., rectilinear motion, (2) motion \\nin two dimensions, i.e., motion in a plane and, \\n(3) motion in three dimensions, i.e., motion in \\nspace. The above cited examples correspond to \\nthree types of motions, respectively. You have \\nstudied rectilinear motion in earlier standards. \\nIn rectilinear motion the force acting on the \\nobject and the velocity of the object both are \\nalong one and the same line. The distances are \\nmeasured along the line only and we can indicate \\ndistances along the +ve and –ve axes as being \\npositive and negative, respectively. The study \\nof the motion of an object in a plane or in space \\nbecomes much easier and the corresponding \\nequations become more elegant if we use vector \\nquantities. In this  Chapter  we will first recall \\nbasic facts about rectilinear motion. We will \\nuse vector notation for this study as it will be \\nuseful later when we will study the motion in \\ntwo dimensions. We will then study the motion \\nin two dimensions which will be restricted to \\nprojectile motion only. Circular motion, i.e., the \\nmotion of an object around a circular path will \\nbe introduced here and will be studied in detail \\nin the next standard.\\n3.2 Rectilinear Motion:\\nConsider an object moving along a straight \\nline. Let us assume this line to be along the \\nx-axis. Let \\nx\\n\\uf072\\n1  and x\\n\\uf072\\n2  be the position vectors \\nof the body at times t1 and t2 during its motion.  \\nMotion in a Plane3.\\nThe following quantities can be defined for the \\nmotion.\\n 1.  Displacement: The displacement of the \\nobject between t1 and t2 is the difference \\nbetween the position vectors of the object at \\nthe two instances. Thus, the displacement \\nis given by\\n    \\nsx xx\\n\\uf072\\uf072 \\uf072\\uf072\\n/g32/g32/g16/g39 21          --- (3.1) \\n   Its direction is along the line of motion \\nof the object. Its dimensions are that of \\nlength. For example, if an object has \\ntravelled through 1 m from time t\\n1 to t 2 \\nalong the +ve x-direction, the magnitude \\nof its displacement is 1 m and its direction \\nis along the +ve x-axis. On the other \\nhand, if the object travelled along the \\n+ve y direction through the same distance \\nin the same time, the magnitude of its \\ndisplacement is the same as before, i.e., 1 \\nm but the direction of the displacement is \\nalong the +ve y-axis. \\n 2.  Path length: This is the actual distance \\ntravelled by the object during its motion. \\nIt is a scalar quantity and its dimensions \\nare also that of length. If an object travels \\nalong the x-axis from x = 2 m to x = 5 m \\nthen the distance travelled is 3 m. In this \\ncase the displacement is also 3 m and its \\ndirection is along the +ve x-axis. However, \\nif the object now comes back to x = 4, then \\nthe distance through which the object has \\nmoved increases to 3 + 1 = 4 m. Its initial \\nposition was x = 2 m and the final position \\nis now x = 4 m and thus, its displacement \\nis ∆x = 4 – 2 = 2 m, i.e., the magnitude of \\nthe displacement is 2 m and its direction \\nis along the +ve x-axis. If the object now \\nmoves to x =1, then the distance travelled, \\ni.e., the path length increases to 4 + 3 ='),\n",

Average velocity: This is defined as the \\ndisplacement of the object during the time \\ninterval over which average velocity is \\nbeing calculated, divided by that time \\ninterval. As displacement is a vector \\nquantity, the velocity is also a vector \\nquantity.  Its dimensions are [L\\n1 M0 T-1]. \\nIf the position vectors of the object are x\\n\\uf072\\n1\\nand x\\n\\uf072\\n2  at times t1 and t2 respectively, then \\nthe average velocity is given by \\n    \\nvav\\n\\uf072 \\uf072\\uf072\\n/g32/g16xx21\\n()t- t21     \\n--- (3.2)\\n  For example, if the positions of an object \\nare x = +2 m and x = +4 m at times t = 0 and \\nt = 1 minute respectively, the magnitude \\nof  its average velocity during that time is  \\nv\\nav = (4 - 2)/(1- 0) = 2 m per minute and its \\ndirection will be along the +ve x-axis, and \\nwe write v\\n/arrowrightnosp/circumflexnospav i= 2  m/min where i\\uf024 is a unit \\nvector along x-axis.\\n 4.  Average speed: This is defined as the \\ntotal path length travelled during the time \\ninterval over which average speed is being \\ncalculated, divided by that time interval. \\n   Average speed = v\\nav = path length/time \\ninterval. It is a scalar quantity and has the \\nsame dimensions as that of velocity, i.e., \\n[L\\n1 M0 T-1].\\n  If the rectilinear motion of the object is \\nonly in one direction along a line, then \\nthe magnitude of its displacement will \\nbe equal to the distance travelled and so \\nthe magnitude of average velocity will be \\nequal to the average speed. However if the \\nobject reverses its direction (the motion \\nremaining along the same line) then the \\nmagnitude of displacement will be smaller \\nthan the path length and the average \\nspeed will be larger than the magnitude of \\naverage velocity.\\n 5.  Instantaneous velocity: Instantaneous \\nvelocity of an object is its velocity at a \\ngiven instant of time. It is defined as the \\nlimiting value of the average velocity of \\nthe object over a small time interval (∆t) \\naround t when the value of the time interval \\n(∆t) goes to zero. \\n   \\nv\\n/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp\\n△\\n/g32 /g167\\n/g169\\n/g168/g168\\n/g183\\n/g185\\n/g184\\n/g184/g32\\n/g111\\nlim\\nt\\nx\\nt\\ndx\\ndt0\\n/g39\\n/g39\\n,  --- (3.3)\\n   dx\\ndt\\n\\uf072\\n being the derivative of x\\n\\uf072\\n with respect \\n \\n  to t (see  Chapter  2).\\n 6.  Instantaneous speed: Instantaneous speed \\nis the speed of an object at a given instant \\nof time t. It is the limiting value of the \\naverage speed of the object taken over \\na small time interval (∆t) around t when \\nthe time interval goes to zero. In such a \\nlimit, the path length will be equal to the \\nmagnitude of the displacement and so the \\ninstantaneous speed will always be equal \\nto the magnitude of the instantaneous \\nvelocity of the object.\\nAlways Remember:\\nFor uniform rectilinear motion, i.e., for an \\nobject moving with constant velocity along \\na straight line \\n 1.  The average and instantaneous \\nvelocities are equal.\\n 2.  The average and instantaneous speeds \\nare the same and are equal to the \\nmagnitude of the velocity.\\nFor nonuniform rectilinear motion\\n 1.

The average speed will be different \\nfrom the magnitude of average velocity.\\nExample 3.1: A person walks from point P to \\npoint Q along a straight road in 10 minutes, \\nthen turns back and returns to point R which \\nis midway between P and Q after further 4 \\nminutes.

Vector \\nnotation was not included here as the motion \\nwas rectilinear.\\nThe most common example of uniform \\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration of \\nan object in day to day life is a freely falling \\nbody. When a body starts with zero velocity at \\na certain height from the ground and falls under \\nthe influence of the gravity of the  Earth , it is \\nsaid to be in free fall. The only other force that \\nacts on it is that of the air resistance or friction. \\nFor displacements of a few metres, this force is \\ntoo small and can be neglected.  The acceleration \\nof the body is the acceleration due to gravity \\nwhich is along the vertical direction and  can be \\nassumed to be constant over distances which are \\nsmall compared to the radius of the  Earth . Thus \\nthe velocity and acceleration are both along the \\nvertical direction and the motion is a uniform \\nrectilinear motion with uniform acceleration. \\nThe distance travelled by an object starting \\nfrom rest and having a uniform acceleration \\nin successive seconds are in the ratio \\n1:3:5:7... Consider a freely falling object.  \\nLet us calculate the distances travelled by \\nit in equal intervals of time t\\n0 (say). This \\ncan be done using the second equation \\nof motion s = u t\\n0 +(1/2) g t0\\n2. The initial \\nvelocity is zero. Therefore, the distance \\ntravelled in the first t\\n0 interval = (1/2) g \\nt0\\n2. For simplification let us write (1/2) \\ng = A. Then the distance travelled in the \\nfirst t\\n0 time interval = d 1 = At0\\n2. In the time \\ninterval 2t0, the distance travelled = A(2t0)2. \\nHence, the distance travelled in the second \\nt\\n0 interval is d 2 = A(4t 0\\n2 - t 0\\n2) = 3A t 0\\n2 = 3 \\nd1. The distance travelled in time interval \\n3t0 = A(3t 0)2. Thus, the distance travelled \\nin the 3 rd t0 interval = d 3 = A(9t 0\\n2 – 4t 0\\n2) =  \\n5A t0\\n2 = 5d1. Continuing, one can see that the \\ndistances d1, d2, d3 .. are in the ratio 1:3:5:7...\\nThis is true for any rectilinear motion, \\nstarting from rest, with positive uniform \\nacceleration.\\nDo you know ?\\nExample 3.2: A stone is thrown vertically \\nupwards from the ground with a velocity 15 \\nm/s. At the same instant a ball is dropped from \\na point directly above the stone from a height \\nof 30 m. At what height from the ground will \\nthe stone and the ball meet and after how much \\ntime? (Use g = 10 m/s\\n2  for ease of calculation). \\nSolution: Let us assume that the stone and \\nthe ball meet after time t 0. The distances (not \\ndisplacements) travelled by the stone and the \\nball in that time can be obtained from Eq. (3.8) \\nas \\n s\\nstone = 15 t0 – 1\\n2  g t0\\n2\\n s ball = 1\\n2  g t0\\n2\\nWhen they meet, sstone + sball = 30 \\n 15 t0 - 1\\n2  g t0\\n2 + 1\\n2  g t0\\n2 = 30\\n t 0 = 30/15 = 2 s\\n∴ sstone = 15 (2) – /nobreakspace1\\n2  (10) (2)2 = 30 -20 =10 m\\nThus the stone and the ball meet at a height of \\n10 m.\\n8. Relative Velocity: You must have often \\nexperienced relative motion. The most striking \\nexample is when you are going in a train and \\nanother train travelling in the same direction \\nalong parallel tracks, overtakes you. If you look \\nat that train, it actually seems to be moving \\nmuch slower than what your train seemed \\nto move and yet it is overtaking you. On the \\nother hand if your train overtakes another \\ntrain, travelling on a parallel track in the same \\ndirection, and you look at that train, you feel \\nthat your train has suddenly slowed down. Why \\ndoes this happen? This is because when you \\nlook at the neighbouring train, you are actually \\nexperiencing relative motion, i.e., your motion \\nwith respect to the other train or the motion \\nof the other train with respect to you. Thus, in \\nthe first case as the other train overtakes you \\nwhat you perceive is the velocity of the train \\nwith respect to you, i.e., the difference in the \\nvelocities of the two trains which most often is \\nmuch smaller than the velocity of your train. In \\nthe second case, you are moving faster but when \\nyou look at that train you only feel your velocity'),\n",

We \\ncan define relative velocity of object A with \\nrespect to object B as the difference between \\ntheir velocities, i.e., \\n v\\nAB = vA – vB    --- (3.10) \\nSimilarly, the velocity of B with respect to A is \\ngiven by \\n v\\nBA = vB – vA    --- (3.11) \\nWe assume that at time t = 0, A and B were \\nat the same point x = 0. As they are travelling \\nwith different velocities, the distance between \\nthem will go on increasing with time in direct \\nproportion to the difference in their velocities, \\ni.e., the relative velocity between them. \\nExample 3.3: An aeroplane A, is travelling \\nin a straight line with a velocity of 300 km/hr \\nwith respect to Earth. Another aeroplane B, \\nis travelling in the opposite direction with a \\nvelocity of 350 km/hr with respect to Earth. \\nWhat is the relative velocity of A with respect \\nto B? What should be the velocity of a third \\naeroplane C moving parallel to A, relative to \\nthe  Earth  if it has a relative velocity of 100 \\nkm/hr with respect to A?\\nSolution: Let v\\nA, vB and vC be the velocities of \\nthe three planes relative to the Earth. Relative \\nvelocity of A with respect to B = vAB = vA - vB = \\n300 – (-350) = 650 km/hr\\nRelative velocity of C with respect to A = vCA = \\nvC - vA = 100 km/hr.\\nThus, vC = vCA + vA= 400 km/hr\\n3.3 Motion in Two Dimensions-Motion in a \\nPlane:\\nSo far we were considering rectilinear \\nmotion of an object. The direction of motion of \\nthe object was always along one straight line. \\nNow we will consider the motion of an object \\nin two dimensions, i.e., along a plane. Here, the \\ndirection of the force acting on an object will not \\nbe in the same line as its initial velocity. Thus, \\nthe velocity and acceleration will have different \\ndirections. For this reason we have to use vector \\nequations. The definitions of various terms \\ngiven in section 3.2 will remain valid except \\nthat the magnitude of the average velocity and \\nthe value of average speed will be different as \\nthe magnitude of the displacement need not \\nbe equal to the path length. For example, if a \\nparticle travels along a circle and comes back \\nto its original position, its displacement will \\nbe zero but the path length will be equal to the \\ncircumference of the circle.\\n3.3.1 Average and Instantaneous Velocities:\\nFor studying the motion of an object in two \\ndimensions, for simplicity, we will take the plane \\nto be the x-y plane. To describe the position of \\nan object in this plane we will have to specify, \\nboth its x and y coordinates. The definitions \\nof displacement, average and instantaneous \\nvelocities, average and instantaneous speeds \\nand acceleration will be the same as those for \\nrectilinear motion except that each of these \\nquantities will now have components along the \\nx and y directions. Let us assume the object to \\nbe at point P at time t\\n1 as shown in Fig. 3.4 (a).\\n \\nFig. 3.4 (a) Motion in two dimensions\\nFig. 3.4 (b) Instantaneous velocity\\nThe position of the object will be described \\nby its position vector \\n.

We often \\nsee projectile motion in our day-to-day life. \\nChildren throw stones towards trees for getting \\ntamarind pods or mangoes. A bowler bowls a \\nball towards a batsman in cricket, a basket ball \\nplayer throws a ball towards the basket, all these \\nare illustrations of projectile motion. In this \\nmotion, we have objects (projectiles) with given \\ninitial velocity, moving under the influence of \\nthe  Earth's gravitational field. The projectile \\nhas two components of velocity, one in the \\nhorizontal, i.e., along x-direction and the other \\nin the vertical, i.e., along the y direction. The \\nacceleration due to gravity acts only along the \\nvertically downward direction. The horizontal \\ncomponent of velocity, therefore, remains \\nunchanged as no force is acting in the horizontal \\ndirection, while the vertical component changes \\nin accordance with laws of motion with  \\n\\uf072a x being 0 and \\uf072a y (= −\\uf072g ) being the downward \\nacceleration due to gravity (upward is positive). \\nUnless stated otherwise, retarding forces like air \\nresistance, etc., are neglected for the projectile \\nmotion.\\nLet us assume that the initial velocity of \\nthe projectile is \\n\\uf072u  and its direction makes an \\nangle θ with the horizontal as shown in Fig. \\n3.5. The projectile is thrown from the ground. \\nWe take the x-axis along the ground and y-axis \\nin the vertical direction. The horizontal and \\nvertical components of initial velocity are u\"),\n",

At that time the height of the \\nprojectile is maximum. The velocity then \\nstarts increasing in the downward direction as \\nthe particle is now falling under the  Earth 's \\ngravitational field with a constant horizontal \\ncomponent of velocity. After a while the \\nprojectile reaches the ground. The trajectory of \\nthe object is shown in Fig. 3.5. The projectile \\nis assumed to start from the origin of the \\ncoordinate system, O. The point of maximum \\nheight is indicated by P and the point where it \\nfalls down to the ground is indicated by Q. The \\nhorizontal and vertical components of velocity \\nare shown at these points as well as at two \\nintermediate points A and B, on the trajectory \\nof the projectile. Note that the horizontal \\ncomponent of velocity remains the same, i.e., \\nu\\nx, while the vertical component decreases \\nand becomes zero at P. After that it changes its \\ndirection, its magnitude increases and becomes \\nequal to u\\ny again at Q. The horizontal distance \\ncovered by the projectile before it falls to the \\nground is OQ. We can derive the equation of \\nthe trajectory of the projectile as follows.\\nLet the time taken by the projectile to reach \\nthe maximum height be t\\n0. The trajectory of the \\nobject being symmetrical, it can be shown by \\nusing equations of motion, that the object will \\ntake the same time in going up in air and coming \\ndown to the ground. At the highest point P, t = t\\n0 \\nand vy = 0. Using Eq. (3.39), \\nwe get, 0 = u sinθ – gt0\\n t 0 = (u sinθ)/g    --- (3.43)\\n∴ Total time in air = T = 2t0 is the time of flight. \\nThe total horizontal distance travelled by \\nthe particle in this time T can be obtained by \\nusing Eq.

Introduction: \\nIf an object continuously changes its \\nposition, it is said to be in motion. Mechanics \\nis a branch of Physics that deals with motion. \\nThere are basically two branches of mechanics \\n(i) Statics, where we deal with objects at rest \\nor in equilibrium under the action of balanced \\nforces and (ii) Kinetics, which deals with actual \\nmotion.\\nKinetics can be further divided into two \\nbranches (i) Kinematics:  In kinematics, we \\ndescribe various motions without discussing \\ntheir cause. Various parameters discussed in \\nkinematics are distance, displacement, speed, \\nvelocity and acceleration. (ii) Dynamics: In \\ndynamics we describe the motion along with its \\ncause, which is force and/or torque. Parameters \\ndiscussed in dynamics are momentum, force, \\nenergy, power, etc. in addition to those in \\nkinematics.\\nIt must be understood that motion is strictly \\na relative concept, i.e., it should always be \\ndescribed in context to a reference frame. For \\nexample, if you are in a running bus, neither \\nyou nor your co-passengers sitting in the bus are \\nin motion in your reference, i.e., moving bus. \\nHowever, from the ground reference, bus, you \\nand all the passengers are in motion.\\nIf not random, motions in real life may \\nbe understood separately as linear, circular \\nor rotational, oscillatory, etc., or some \\ncombinations of these. While describing any \\nof these, we need to know the corresponding \\nforces responsible for these motions. Trajectory \\nof any motion is decided by acceleration \\n\\uf072a \\xa0 and \\nthe initial velocity \\uf072u .\\nLaws of Motion4.\\n 1. What are different types of motions? \\n 2.  What do you mean by kinematical equations \\nand what are they? \\n 3.  Newton’s laws of motion apply to most \\nbodies we come across in our daily lives.\\n 4. All bodies are governed by Newton’s law of \\ngravitation. Gravitation of the Earth results \\ninto weight of objects. \\nCan you recall?\\n a)  Linear motion: Initial velocity may be \\nzero or non-zero. If initial velocity is zero \\n(starting from rest), acceleration in any \\ndirection will result into a linear motion.\\n  If initial velocity is not zero, the \\nacceleration must be in line with the initial \\nvelocity (along the same or opposite \\ndirection to that of the initial velocity) for \\nresultant motion to be linear.\\n b)  Circular motion: If initial velocity is \\nnot zero and acceleration is throughout \\nperpendicular to the velocity, the resultant \\nmotion will be circular. \\n c)  Parabolic motion: If acceleration is \\nconstant and initial velocity is not in \\nline with the acceleration, the motion is \\nparabolic, e.g., trajectory of a projectile \\nmotion.\\n d)  Other combinations of \\n\\uf072u  and \\uf072a  will result \\ninto different more complicated motion.\\n4.2. Aristotle’s Fallacy: \\nAristotle (384BC-322BC) stated that \\n“an external force is required to keep a body \\nin uniform motion”. This was probably based \\non a common experience like a ball rolling \\non a surface stops after rolling through some \\ndistance. Thus, to keep the ball moving with \\nconstant velocity, we have to continuously \\napply a force on it. Similar examples can be \\nfound elsewhere, like a paper plane flying \\nthrough air or a paper boat propelled with some \\ninitial velocity.\\nCorrect explanation to Aristotle’s fallacy \\nwas first given by Galileo (1564-1642), which \\nwas later used by Newton (1643-1727) in \\n 5.  Acceleration is directly proportional to \\nforce for fixed mass of an object.\\n 6.  Bodies possess potential energy and kinetic \\nenergy due to their position and motion \\nrespectively which may change. Their \\ntotal energy is conserved in absence of any \\nexternal force.'),\n",

Galileo showed \\nthat all the objects stop moving because of \\nsome resistive or opposing forces like friction, \\nviscous drag, etc. In these examples such forces \\nare frictional force for rolling ball, viscous \\ndrag or viscous force of air for paper plane and \\nviscous force of water for the boat.\\nThus, in reality, for an uninterrupted \\nmotion of a body an additional external force is \\nrequired for overcoming these opposing forces. \\nWhat is then special about Newton’s \\nfirst law if it is derivable from Newton’s \\nsecond law?\\nCan you tell?\\n4.3.1. Importance of Newton’s First Law of \\n          Motion:\\n (i)  It shows an equivalence between ‘state \\nof rest’ and ‘state of uniform motion \\nalong a straight line’ as both need a net \\nunbalanced force to change the state. Both \\nthese are referred to as ‘state of motion’. \\nThe distinction between state of rest and \\nuniform motion lies in the choice of the \\n‘frame of reference’.\\n (ii)  It defines force as an entity (or a physical \\nquantity) that brings about a change in \\nthe ‘state of motion’ of a body, i.e., force \\nis something that initiates a motion or \\ncontrols a motion. Second law gives \\nits quantitative understanding or its \\nmathematical expression.\\n (iii) It defines inertia as a fundamental property \\nof every physical object by which the \\nobject resists any change in its state of \\nmotion. Inertia is measured as the mass \\nof the object. More specifically it is called \\ninertial mass, which is the ratio of net force \\n( |\\nF\\n/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp|) to the corresponding acceleration  \\n(|a\\n\\uf072\\n|).\\n4.3.2. Importance of Newton’s Second Law \\n          of Motion:\\n (i)  It gives mathematical formulation for \\nquantitative measure of force as rate of \\nchange of linear momentum.\\nMathematical expression for force must be \\nremembered as F dp\\ndt\\n/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp\\n=  and not as Fm a\\n/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp=\\nF dp\\ndt\\ndm\\ndt\\ndm\\ndt m d\\ndt\\n/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp\\n/g32/g32 /g11/g12/g32 /g11/g12/g14/g167\\n/g169/g168\\n/g183\\n/g185/g184\\nv v v\\n \\n/g32 /g11/g12/g14dm\\ndt ma\\uf072\\uf072v\\nFor a given body, mass is constant, i.e., \\ndm\\ndt  = 0  and only in this case, Fm a\\n/combarrowextender/arrowrightnosp/arrowrightnosp=\\nIn the case of a rocket, both the terms \\nare needed as both mass and velocity are \\nvarying. \\nDo you know ?\\n1.

Newton’s Laws of Motion: \\nFirst law: Every inanimate object continues to \\nbe in its state of rest or of uniform unaccelerated \\nmotion unless and until it is acted upon by an \\nexternal, unbalanced force. \\nSecond law: Rate of change of linear momentum \\nof a rigid body is directly proportional to the \\napplied force and takes place in the direction of \\nthe applied force.

Inertial and Non-Inertial Frames of \\nReference \\nConsider yourself standing on a railway \\nplatform or a bus stand and you see a train or \\nbus moving. According to you, that train or bus \\nis moving or is in motion. As per the experience \\nof the passengers in the train or bus, they are at \\nrest and you are moving (in backward direction). \\nHence motion itself is a relative concept. To \\nknow or describe a motion you need to describe \\nor define some reference. Such a reference \\nis called a frame of reference. In the example \\ndiscussed above, if you consider the platform as \\nthe reference, then the passengers and the train \\nare moving. However, if the train is considered \\nas the reference, you and platform, etc. are \\nmoving.\\nUsually a set of coordinates with a \\nsuitable origin is enough to describe a frame \\nof reference. If position coordinates of an \\nobject are continuously changing with time \\nin a frame of reference, then that object  is in \\nmotion in that frame of reference.

       "\"1\\n1.1 Introduction: \\nPhysics is a quantitative science, where \\nwe measure various physical quantities \\nduring experiments. In our day to day life, we \\nneed to measure a number of quantities, e.g., \\nsize of objects, volume of liquids, amount of \\nmatter, weight of vegetables or fruits, body \\ntemperature, length of cloth, etc. A measurement \\nalways involves a comparison with a standard \\nmeasuring unit which is internationally \\naccepted. For example, for measuring the mass \\nof a given fruit we need standard mass units \\nof 1 kg, 500 g, etc. These standards are called \\nunits. The measured quantity is expressed in \\nterms of a number followed by a corresponding \\nunit, e.g., the length of a wire is written as 5 m \\nwhere m (metre) is the unit and 5 is the value of \\nthe length in that unit. Different quantities are \\nmeasured in different units, e.g. length in metre \\n(m), time in seconds (s), mass in kilogram (kg), \\netc. The standard measure of any quantity is \\ncalled the unit of that quantity. \\n1.2 System of Units:\\nIn our earlier standards we have come \\nacross various systems of units namely\\n (i)  CGS: Centimetre  Gram Second system\\n (ii)  MKS: Metre Kilogram Second system\\n (iii) FPS: Foot Pound Second system.\\n (iv) SI: System International\\nThe first three systems namely CGS, MKS \\nand FPS were used extensively till recently.  In \\n1971, the 14\\nth International general conference \\non weights and measures recommended the \\nuse of ‘International system' of units. This \\ninternational system of units is called the \\nSI units. As the SI units use decimal system, \\nconversion within the system is very simple and \\nconvenient.\\n1. What is a unit?\\n2. Which units have you used in the laboratory for measuring \\n  (i) length (ii) mass (iii) time (iv) temperature?\\n3. Which system of units have you used?  \\nUnits and Measurements\\nCan you recall?\\n1.2.1 Fundamental Quantities and Units:  \\nThe physical quantities which do not \\ndepend on any other physical quantities for \\ntheir measurements are known as fundamental \\nquantities. There are seven fundamental \\nquantities: length, mass, time, temperature, \\nelectric current, luminous intensity and amount \\nof substance. \\nFundamental units: The units used to measure \\nfundamental quantities are called fundamental \\nunits.

In our day to day life, we \\nneed to measure a number of quantities, e.g., \\nsize of objects, volume of liquids, amount of \\nmatter, weight of vegetables or fruits, body \\ntemperature, length of cloth, etc. A measurement \\nalways involves a comparison with a standard \\nmeasuring unit which is internationally \\naccepted. For example, for measuring the mass \\nof a given fruit we need standard mass units \\nof 1 kg, 500 g, etc. These standards are called \\nunits. The measured quantity is expressed in \\nterms of a number followed by a corresponding \\nunit, e.g., the length of a wire is written as 5 m \\nwhere m (metre) is the unit and 5 is the value of \\nthe length in that unit. Different quantities are \\nmeasured in different units, e.g. length in metre \\n(m), time in seconds (s), mass in kilogram (kg), \\netc. The standard measure of any quantity is \\ncalled the unit of that quantity. \\n1.2 System of Units:\\nIn our earlier standards we have come \\nacross various systems of units namely\\n (i)  CGS: Centimetre  Gram Second system\\n (ii)  MKS: Metre Kilogram Second system'),\n",
